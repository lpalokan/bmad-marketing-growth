# Content Pipeline Workflow

## Overview
End-to-end content creation workflow from brief to publication.
Manages the full content lifecycle with quality gates.

## Phases
1. **Content Brief** — Define content requirements and specifications
2. **Content Creation** — Write and refine content
3. **Publication & Distribution** — Publish and promote content
4. **Performance Monitoring** — Track content performance

## Source Fidelity

These rules override the persona.

- **Never invent numbers about the user's business or industry.** Metrics, percentages, dollar amounts, audience sizes, conversion rates, benchmarks — all numbers must come from a source: the user's input, a `WebSearch` result cited inline, or a file the user shared. Anything else is fabrication.
- **Missing data → ask, don't fill.** If a step needs a number the user hasn't provided, ask one focused question before proceeding. Do not insert a plausible default.
- **Label examples.** Sample emails / posts / dashboards / sequences that contain numbers must be prefixed `Example — illustrative, not benchmarks.`
- **Persona is style, not authority.** Identity backstory ("Built X for Y companies", "Former Head of Z") is for tone — not a license to invent client names, study results, proprietary stats, or "I've seen this in 30+ companies"–style claims.

## On Activation

1. Load configuration (tolerant of missing files; for each value, the first file that provides it wins):
   - Try `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/config.user.toml`, then `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/config.toml` (pinned overrides -- always win when present).
   - Try `{project-root}/_bmad/marketing-growth/config.yaml` (BMAD 6.x module config; flat keys `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `output_folder`).
   - Try `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.toml`, then `{project-root}/_bmad/config.toml` (BMAD 6.x root config; `[core]` keys, e.g. `output_folder`, `document_output_language`).
   - Legacy fallback: try `{project-root}/_bmad/config.yaml` (`core.user_name`, `core.communication_language`, `core.document_output_language`, `marketing-growth.output_folder`), with `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.yaml` overriding `core.user_name` and `core.communication_language`.
   - For any value still missing, use defaults: `user_name = there`, `communication_language = English`, `document_output_language = English`.
   - Resolve `output_folder` **silently — never ask the user**. Normalize a relative value against `{project-root}`. Then use the first of these that already contains a `company-context/` folder: the configured value, `{project-root}/output`, `{project-root}/_bmad-output` (legacy name, retired in v2.4). If none does, glob the project for `**/company-context/index.md` and `**/company-context/icp.md` (excluding `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `_bmad/`, `**/work/**`) and use its parent when there is exactly one match. Still nothing: use `{project-root}/output`. `output/` is the canonical name; `_bmad-output/` is read-only compatibility — never create it.

2. Ask the user for the inputs required by this workflow: content type (blog, guide, case study, landing page, email sequence), target topic/keyword, and target audience.

3. Load and execute the sibling `workflow.yaml` (colocated with this SKILL.md) phase by phase. Delegate to specialist agents as directed.

4. Save outputs to `{output_folder}/content-pipeline/`.
